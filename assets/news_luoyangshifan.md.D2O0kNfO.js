The lecture, titled <strong>&quot;The Cognitive Revolution in the Era of Large Models: How Should We Learn?&quot;</strong>, took the audience on a journey through the history of artificial intelligence (AI) development and prompted deep reflection on the profound changes in human learning patterns in the AI era.</p><h3 id="starting-with-the-past-and-present-of-ai" tabindex="-1">Starting with &quot;The Past and Present of AI&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#starting-with-the-past-and-present-of-ai" aria-label="Permalink to “Starting with &quot;The Past and Present of AI&quot;”">​</a></h3><p>Dr. Li began with a lively overview of AI’s evolution—from 20th-century symbolic and connectionist approaches to today’s reinforcement learning and large-scale models. He noted that early AI’s “rigorous logic” was hampered by “vague definitions,” illustrating the point with humorous “garbage logic” examples that both educated and entertained.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Dr. Li Yansong"></p><h3 id="breakthroughs-and-challenges-in-ai-development" tabindex="-1">Breakthroughs and Challenges in AI Development <a class="header-anchor" href="#breakthroughs-and-challenges-in-ai-development" aria-label="Permalink to “Breakthroughs and Challenges in AI Development”">​</a></h3><p>He examined how machine learning and reinforcement learning are reshaping fields from visual recognition to language generation and from gaming to real-world decision-making. He also stated frankly, “No matter how powerful AI becomes, it still depends on human experience and logic”, especially given ongoing challenges in training time and generalization.</p><h3 id="next-stop-agents-and-ai-autonomy" tabindex="-1">Next Stop: Agents and AI Autonomy <a class="header-anchor" href="#next-stop-agents-and-ai-autonomy" aria-label="Permalink to “Next Stop: Agents and AI Autonomy”">​</a></h3><p>When looking into the future of AI, Dr. Li particularly pointed out the development trend of &quot;Agent&quot; systems. He predicted that future AI will have stronger autonomy, capable of independently searching for information, processing documents, and running code, gradually moving from &quot;human scheduling&quot; to &quot;AI autonomous planning.&quot; He cited METR research showing that autonomous AI capability follows a &quot;Moore’s Law&quot; of its own: &quot;The time AI can work autonomously doubles every seven months.&quot;</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Lecture Scene"></p><h3 id="how-should-humans-learn-what-can-ai-bring" tabindex="-1">How Should Humans Learn? What Can AI Bring? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-should-humans-learn-what-can-ai-bring" aria-label="Permalink to “How Should Humans Learn? What Can AI Bring?”">​</a></h3><p>Dr. Li argued that future AI will be more than a tool—it will be a partner. To tackle continuous learning, ultra-long contexts, and cross-dimensional reasoning, AI still relies on the experience and logic humans provide. He encouraged students to embrace multimodal, interactive learning and to use AI to build their own knowledge networks.</p><h3 id="liii-stem-making-interactive-learning-and-scientific-writing-more-efficient" tabindex="-1">Liii STEM: Making Interactive Learning and Scientific Writing More Efficient <a class="header-anchor" href="#liii-stem-making-interactive-learning-and-scientific-writing-more-efficient" aria-label="Permalink to “Liii STEM: Making Interactive Learning and Scientific Writing More Efficient”">​</a></h3><p>Beyond sparking thoughts, Dr. Li also introduced <strong>Liii STEM</strong>, the intelligent scientific writing platform he and his team created. This is an AI scientific writing platform specifically designed for scientific writing scenarios in the AI era. The platform&#39;s built-in AI interactive writing features will help build personal knowledge graphs. The platform integrates core functions such as code execution, paper typesetting, chart creation, and intelligent generation, along with innovative experiences like &quot;magic paste,&quot; dedicated to creating a zero-threshold scientific writing environment and empowering technological innovation and AI education.</p><p>He joked: &quot;In the past, scientific writing was like piecing together a puzzle with various tools, but we hope that through AI, you can truly <strong>complete the entire scientific writing process in one place</strong>, from &#39;thinking&#39; to &#39;writing&#39;, seamlessly online.&quot;</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Active Q&amp;A from the Audience"></p><h3 id="lively-atmosphere-and-continuous-interaction" tabindex="-1">Lively Atmosphere and Continuous Interaction <a class="header-anchor" href="#lively-atmosphere-and-continuous-interaction" aria-label="Permalink to “Lively Atmosphere and Continuous Interaction”">​</a></h3><p>The session ended with enthusiastic questions on AI ethics and career prospects. Many students said the talk not only delivered cutting-edge insights but also sparked profound reflection on how we learn. Dr. Li closed with a rallying call:</p><blockquote><p><strong>&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of difficulty, leave the difficult tasks to AI, let&#39;s focus on more creative things.&quot;</strong></p></blockquote><p>This might be the most thought-provoking learning revolution in the era of large models.</p>',20)])])}const w=n(l,[["render",h]]);export{f as __pageData,w as default};
